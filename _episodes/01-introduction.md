## Machine Learning

Machine learning refers to algorithms that help computers learn to solve problems through experience.
In its most common form, *supervised learning*, this involves providing the machine with labeled 
examples that are each a pair of data and desired output and tasking the machine with learning to 
produce the output when a new unlabeled example is provided. For instance, the data could be pictures 
of animals and the desired output could be the identification of what kind of animal the picture represents. 
Machine learning algorithms work around *models* that transform the input data (that has been suitably 
pre-processed to work with the model) into a *predicted* output value. The goal of machine learning is 
to derive the necessary parameters of these models such that the computed output value is as close as 
possible to the actual output value.

### Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

Machine learning can be used to process large quantities of data and derive some useful insights. In 
cybersecurity, this most commonly involves the detection of anomalies in various kinds of system data. 
For instance, we can apply machine learning to detect network traffic data that resembles a DDoS style 
attack and flag the source IPs of this traffic for further inspection or monitoring.

In this set of lessons we will learn about various such applications of machine learning for cybersecurity.
